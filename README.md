# AmazonFlex Order Tracker

This project is designed to help track orders for Amazon Flex drivers and record any issues for later records. It consists of an HTML frontend and a Go backend.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the frontend.
- `main.go`: The main Go file for the backend.

## Roadmap

- ~~Database to be connected.~~
- Maybe implement a endpoint to fetch all data stored.
