# AmazonFlex AWB Finder

The AmazonFlex AWB Finder is a tool or application designed to assist Amazon Flex drivers in quickly locating, organizing, and referencing AWB (Air Waybill) numbers and associated delivery dates. This tool addresses common challenges faced by drivers, such as keeping track of numerous AWB numbers for packages and ensuring they are associated with the correct delivery schedule and to be later referenced when required.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the frontend.
- `main.go`: The main Go file for the backend.

## Roadmap

- ~~Database to be connected.~~
- Maybe implement a endpoint to fetch all data stored.
